# Stock-Movement-Prediction-CNN

## Introduction:
Multivariate time series data are ubiquitous in many practical applications ranging from health care, geoscience, astronomy, to biology and others.

In this project, I  trained a convolutional neural network to take in an image of a graph of time series data for past prices of a given assets and then predict the movement of the price in the next day.
